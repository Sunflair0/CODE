                Traditionally a resumé will only have the most recent years of experience. Being new to web
                development, I don't have much paid practice in the industry (yet!), but I have many experiences
                and skills that are valuable. If you would like to know my history, read on!

Ford Credit emphasized teamwork with a self-managed structure and team-building workshops. Ameritrade (before the TD) was still small when I started. Over the course 7+ years I worked in almost every department. At one point I handled tech support for the business accounts (email, phone and pager), selected and taught co-workers to replace me as needed."
data-tldr_text2="At PayPal I single-handedly worked tech support for business accounts. At Cox Cable, Mulhalls and Liberty Tax I worked with the public using my soft skills that were 20 years in the making at that point. HDM was my first remote job. Processing insurance claims for the VA required a high level of concentration and attention to detail. I am highly analytical and enjoy working with people.">
