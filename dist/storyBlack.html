                        choose cards to get closest to the card value 21 without going over. But, you must also beat the
                        dealer's hand.

                    class="storyProjectName">BlackJack(ish)</a>&nbspis a simple program written to improve my Javascript
                skills. I had the wonderful
                opportunity to put into action and gain a better understanding of JS concepts such as hoisting,
                understanding scope and closure. <br><br>
                After completing the base program, I came back to it to expand it by implementing a light/dark theme and
                granting the user the deck choice. It gives me personal joy to find creative ways to grant the user
                choices in a program.
                <br><br>Adding on to the program taught me the value of inter-program comments, and how to simplify my
                program to make it easier to modify and/or understand for those that come after that wish to manipulate
                the code (even if
                that is a future version of myself!). These are lessons every coder must learn.
