                        There are 30 seconds per round to accumulate the goal score, 500. There are four <span

                    class="storyProjectName">CashSmash</a> I came back to it to expand it by implementing a dark theme
                and
                granting the user the deck choice. It gives me personal joy to find creative ways to grant the user
                choices in a program.
                <br><br>Adding on to the program taught me the value of inter-program comments, and how to simplify my
                program to make it easier to modify and/or understand for those that come after that wish to manipulate
                the code (even if
                that is a future version of myself!). These are lessons every coder must learn.
            </p>
            <p>I wrote this program to work on my understanding of arrays. I also used IFFE and local storage to store
                the scoreboard results. </p>
